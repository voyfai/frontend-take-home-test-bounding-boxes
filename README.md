Thank you for participating in our technical assessment! This exercise will evaluate your ability to create an interactive document viewer.

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run start
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```


## Assessment Requirements

### Main Requirements
- Render a documents table in a new page
- Load document from the backend when page opens (endpoint is already set but is currently not being called anywhere in the frontend)
- Store response in Redux store
- Create a bounding box and document viewer
- render the image base64 data in to a docment viewer and add bounding boxes of the items included in the response

### Interaction Requirements
- Clicking an item in the table should highlight or show selected the corresponding bounding box in the document viewer
- Clicking a bounding box should highlight the corresponding row in the table
- Implement a toggle option on the table row  to show either all bounding boxes or just one
- The bounding boxes should hold their size when the page is resized
- the bounding boxes should show the title of the attribute they correlate to
- take in to consideration that the bounding boxes unit of measure is in inches you can use the azure ocr documentation for further reference
